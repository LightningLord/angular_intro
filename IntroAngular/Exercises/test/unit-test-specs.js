/*
 * Build a set of unit tests for the controller you completed in the last
 * exercise. The structure should look something like this:
 *
 * describe // Top-level for the TeamApp module
 *   declare variables for testScope and controller, which will be shared
 *           throughout the application.
 *   beforeEach // Load the teamApp module
 *              // Inject the controller lookup service and instantiate a
 *              // scope into testScope
 *   describe // Check data in TeamCtrl
 *     it // Make sure that $scope.teams has ten elements
 *     it // Make sure that the third element is "Red Sox"
 *   describe // Check the function delTeam
 *     it // Should verify that a team has been deleted
 *     it // Should verify that the teams list is shorter
 *   describe // Check the function restoreTeams
 *     it // Should verify that deleted teams have come back
